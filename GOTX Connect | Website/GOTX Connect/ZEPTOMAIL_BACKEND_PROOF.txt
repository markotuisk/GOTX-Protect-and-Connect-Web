ZEPTOMAIL BACKEND VERIFICATION - GOTX CONNECT (TECHNICAL PROOF)

BUSINESS CONTEXT:
GOTX Connect is a Managed IT Services startup. We are currently building our infrastructure. Our website serves as the primary intake for "Task Briefs" from potential clients.

---

TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE:
Our application is built on a modern "Serverless" architecture using Cloudflare Pages. 

- Backend: Cloudflare Pages Functions (v8 Runtime)
- Frontend: HTML5/Vanilla JS/CSS3
- Data Integrity: Cloudflare KV (Key-Value Storage) for persistent logging.

API INTEGRATION & SECURITY (THE "BACKEND"):
We do NOT use SMTP for this application. We have implemented a custom integration using the ZeptoMail REST API.

1. Execution Environment:
All email-sending logic is handled in the "/functions" directory. These scripts run on Cloudflare's Edge network. They are physically inaccessible to users and cannot be viewed by inspecting the website source code.

2. Credential Protection:
Our ZeptoMail API Token is stored as a secret Environment Variable (LOGS_TOKEN or ZEPTOMAIL_TOKEN) in our Cloudflare project settings. It is never hardcoded.

3. Code Snippet Proof:
Below is the representative logic from our "submit.js" backend function. This proves the email is prepared and sent strictly server-side:

--- BEGIN SERVER-SIDE SNIPPET ---

const zeptoUrl = "https://api.zeptomail.eu/v1.1/email";
const zeptoToken = env.ZEPTOMAIL_TOKEN; // Injected from secure vault

const payload = {
    "from": { "address": "no-reply@gotx.uk", "name": "GOTX Website" },
    "to": [
        { "email_address": { "address": "info@gotx.uk", "name": "GOTX Info" } },
        { "email_address": { "address": formData.email, "name": formData.fullName } }
    ],
    "subject": `New Inquiry from ${formData.fullName}: ${formData.userType} [${taskId}]`,
    "htmlbody": emailHtml,
};

const response = await fetch(zeptoUrl, {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
        "Accept": "application/json",
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "Authorization": zeptoToken // Credentials passed securely here
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(payload)
});

--- END SERVER-SIDE SNIPPET ---

SUMMARY FOR AUDIT:
This setup ensures maximum deliverability and security. Because we handle the inquiry server-side, we can also store a local audit log of every email attempt to ensure no critical client data is ever lost.
